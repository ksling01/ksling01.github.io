<div class="counter">
The solar insolation calibration device is a sensor that measures the power of the sunlight at all angles. The device has a diameter of 12 inches and has 256 equally spaced photoresistors mounted on the edge. The inside of the device contains digital logic gates as well as two DAC (Data Aquisition Card) units connected to a computer. One of the cards supplies the power and the logic for the other card to accurately measure 8 of the photoresistors at a time. The data from the cards is read by a computer using Labview software. the device continuously cycles measureing the electrical resistance of the photoresistors. From that information, the power of the sunlight can be determined at every angle and logged onto an excel document.
