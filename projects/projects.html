<a href="http://ksling01.github.io/comp20-kslinger/mmap/"><h1>Map</h1></a>
<br>Map is a project that implements the google maps API. The page takes in the users location if they allow it and then plots it with a special marker on the map. As it does this it requests for another file that stores other users info about their locations on previous logins. The new users location is then stored into the saved file. This is all done with a backend Heroku application that was specifically built to run on this page.</br>

<a href="http://ksling01.github.io/comp20-kslinger/captainslog/"><h1>Captains Log</h1></a>
<br>Captains log is a small project that utilizes an entry form in the webpage. The user types in a message and it is displayed on the page with the time it was entered in. This is done using google Ajax. A method that allows for the webpage to be dynamic without having to reload. Once the data is entered it is stored on the users computer using local storage. Doing this in a script allows for faster processing and less data needed to tansfer between machines. Only that machine can see its own local storage.</br>

<a href="http://ksling01.github.io/comp20-kslinger/responsive/"><h1>Responsive</h1></a>
<br>Responsive is a small project that has one big image stored in it. As the window changes size the part of the image that is displayed also changes. This would simulate the page getting smaller and displaying different information for different screen sizes.</br>

<a href="http://ksling01.github.io/comp20-kslinger/messages/"><h1>Messages</h1></a>
<br>Messages is a small project that demistrates the use of JSON messages. A JSON file holds information that is needed to be displayed on the screen. The html document calls for that JSON file and then parses it to display properly on the screen.
