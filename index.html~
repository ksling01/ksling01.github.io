	<h1>Hi I'm Kyle</h1>
	<h3>I love building unique things, sharing inspiring ideas and helping teach people about technology to enrich 			their lives.</h3>
	
		
		<div>
		I am a recent graduate of Tufts University with a degree in electrical engineering where I also played 			baseball.
		There I worked on various hardware and software projects to refine my skills. In software I am really interested
		in web development and the internet of things. This is included website development as well as networking.
		In hardware I worked a lot with microprocessor development. Using them 
		to develop devices that help with small tasks that help peoples lives.

			I am a California native and currently reside in the east bay area. I am looking for a fast paced working 				environment, to learn with others about 
			technology and how it can help the world. I want to go somehwere everyday that is intellectually stimulating.
			I want to  be challenged everyday by myself and my peers to see what we can achieve.
